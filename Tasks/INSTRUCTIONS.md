We're implementing unit tests one by one.
Everytime, I'll first tell you which tests to implement.
DO NOT move on to the next test yourself unless I tell you to.
Always come back and check with me first.
First read @/Tasks/testing_implementation_checklist.md. 

The procedure is:
1. Implement the test
2. Run test and make sure it passes: npm run test -- --run
3. Use browser action on port 3000 to test there's no error. The dev server is already running.

Make sure by the end, check that both 2 and 3 pass.

4. Update the checklist.
5. Generate the next task by copying the template from @/Tasks\INSTRUCTIONS.md and updating the task number.

# Task: Implement [TASK_NUMBER]
